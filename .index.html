  <p>Dear Amazon Powers That Be,

Greetings from the front lines of middle school education—where dreams go to nap and coffee flows like water.

I’m writing to you today with the humble heart of a public school teacher and the hopeful eyes of someone who just added “blanket that looks like a giant tortilla” to their Amazon wishlist.

I haven’t gone to the bathroom uninterrupted since 2014, my definition of “luxury” is a pen that isn’t chewed on, and my students think I live at school. Your website has been both a source of joy and a form of emotional self-sabotage. Every time I click “Add to Cart,” I feel a rush of hope. Every time I click “Save for Later,” I feel like I’m starring in a tragic indie film scored by a slow ukulele version of “I Will Always Love You.”
 
<strong>So here’s my plea: please consider fulfilling my wishlist. Not all of it, of course (unless Jeff has a change of heart). But even just the “makeup vanity” or the “pink Converse” could vastly improve the quality of my life and classroom.My students would benefit, too. </strong></p>

  <p style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS', cursive, sans-serif;">
    
In conclusion, I am a hard-working, coffee-fueled educator just trying to make it through the school year with a little style and a few unnecessary gadgets. If there’s any room in your algorithmic heart for generosity, I ask you to consider my wishlist.
 <em>
Forever yours in Prime spirit,
Molly, the Teacher with the Giant Tortilla Blanket Dream

P.S. I’ve already cleared a spot for the inflatable unicorn horn for my cat. Let’s make magic happen.
